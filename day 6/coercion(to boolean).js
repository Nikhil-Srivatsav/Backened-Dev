'==' vs '==='

'=='  is Abstract equality.
'===' is Strict equality.


if someone says that == checks value and === cjecks values and types just don't argue with them and ignore them.
understand that he is a fool he has not spent time with javascript.



Now point is both checks value and perform further operations. Then whats the major difference 
Note--> abstract equality checks and performs coercion.
 
strict equality doesnt perform coercion it directly performs operations.
