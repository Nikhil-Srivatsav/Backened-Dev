All the operations like 1+"1" or 1-"1" or "a"+2 are part of java script abstract operations.

they are not executable operations and even we can not perform them but they are mentioned in documentation and 
are written for internal understanding.

what is coercion basically ?
these are all basic internal operations that are meant to be performed for below operations and they arepredefined in java script documentations

We cannot implement them but understand how internally javascript works

console.log(1+"a");

console.log(1-"a");

console.log(1-"99");

console.log("a"+1);
