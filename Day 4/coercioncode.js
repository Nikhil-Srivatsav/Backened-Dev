All the operations like 1+"1" or 1-"1" or "a"+2 are part of java script abstract operations 
they are not executable operations and even we can not perform them but they are mentioned in documentation and 
are written for internal understanding.

console.log(1+"a");

console.log(1-"a");

console.log(1-"99");

console.log("a"+1);
